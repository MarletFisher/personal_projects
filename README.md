Collection of works

1. phone_comic
A working deployed version of my full-stack comic reader web-app â€“ includes register and login functionalities, using NgRX observables, form controls, as well as calling for API hosted images to read comics. Stack is Angular for frontend, a Node express server for API, and a MS SQL relational database hosted on MS Azure. 

2. react-api-searchform
A web UI I created to search collection pieces using the Met Museum API with query parameters. App is written with React and Next.js.

3. countries-react-app
Another web UI created to search up an API I created myself to populate a pagination display with details of various countries.
